Title:
Diabatic effects of ice crystals in extratropical cloud systems

Introduction:
Cheesecake, stuff, blah blah.
Some literature already exists on this (Dearden et al 2016). Recent work by Smith et al also of interest here.

Methodology:
We used in-situ measurements collected during the TROSIAD campaign (Vaughan et al 2016) and did some modelling with the WRF model.

Conclusions:
We found out some new stuff. It was great, but we need money.
